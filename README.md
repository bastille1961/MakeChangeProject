## Make Change Project

#### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

Program is an expanded form of a Cash Register project where the principle objective is to determine
the correct denominations to tender for a given amount of change at the point of sale.
The extension to this program here attempts to mimic a real-world situation where there is are grocery
items listed which first allow the customer/user to select the amount of each item by name.

The program then present a total amount due and allows the user/customer to declare the amount tendered.
This value is evaluated against the total sale and the user/customer is informed as to whether the amount tendered
is sufficient. If sufficient funds are provided, the correct change and denomination in bills and coinage is 
declared.

### How to Run

Respond to all user prompts. Users must enter "0" for zero items selected for a given grocery item or enter the appropriate amount using the number keys. If an insufficient amount is entered as tender the user will be advised accordingly. Entering an amount that is equal to or greater than the amount due will prompt the program to declare the change and denominations to be 
received in the automated teller's receptacle.

## Lessons Learned

1. Declare simpler variables (e.g., 'item 3, 4, 5 etc.,' instead of being overly specific which leads to typographical error.
2. Do not make redundant menus where a change could lead to excessive editing requirements and likelihood of human error.
